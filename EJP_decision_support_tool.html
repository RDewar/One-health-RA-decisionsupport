        <h2>Purpose, scope and caveats</h2>
        <p>This tool is designed to help those who are new to the fields of risk assessment or One-Health find an appropriate risk assessent approach.</p>
        <p>This tool will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Showcase fifteen risk assessment approaches, providing a short description of each</li>
            <li>Broadly assess your needs and limiations using a series of questions</li>
            <li>Make suggestions on those needs and limitations</li>
            <li>Be easily reset and adjusted for changing answers, allowing the user to explore many different paths
            </li>
            <li>Aim to provide access to as many resources as possible</li>
            <li>Provide links to published examples of each approach, outlining how they work and where
                they have succeeded historically</li>
            <li>Be a good starting point to those less familiar with the field</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This tool will not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide the definitive answer to any of the questions that are asked</li>
            <li>Conduct risk assessment in and of itself</li>
            <li>Provide the definitive list of examples for each approach</li>
            <li>Record any of the responses given by the user</li>
            <li>Show any risk assessment resources that are not related to the field of One-Health</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The tool is designed to be simple and user-friendly. Click anywhere in this box to get started!</p>

    Emerging threats are usually non-endemic diseases. This might be a known disease that is reappearing, or a
    previously untracked disease. Assessing the risk of disease spread is generic, and could apply to almost any risk.
    If you are unsure what category your risk question falls in to, then this is the option to choose. In assessing risk
    for policy, you are usually looking
    at an endemic disease, or at a stage in an outbreak where the risk is already known. These are conducted when
    decision-makers need to do something new, but do not know how this will affect the overall risk.

The OIE framework consists of a release (or entry) assessment, exposure assessment, consequence assessment and risk estimation. Hazard Identification is an important first step, but the OIE framework does not consider this part of the risk assessment section of the wider risk analysis methodology which also includes risk management and risk communication.   Steps in the risk assessment process involve: establishing a risk question, drawing a risk pathway, and estimating the risks of each segment of the pathway based on evidence. These are then combined into an overall risk. The process should ideally include an estimate of the level of uncertainty.

It is relatively easy to learn given a medium timescale and can provide an easily interpretable risk estimate. One main disadvantage is that, unlike more advanced quantitative methods such as stochastic risk assessment, it cannot fully integrate uncertainty in to the final estimate. Instead, the impact of uncertainty at each step on the final risk score can be  described qualitatively,  or assessed  through  modelling different scenarios using extreme biologically plausible estimates   for your parameters. Deterministic risk assessment is therefore best used when data variability and uncertainty are low, such that the resource needed for more complex methods may not be necessary. The OIE quantitative risk assessment guidance explains this approach in more detail.  Most deterministic risk assessments are not too complex and can be carried out in Excel, although the assessor is generally best advised to use whichever software they are most comfortable with.  For more complex computational models a programming language such as R, Matlab or Python is recommended.",

A two-stage Monte-Carlo analysis can be used to separate uncertainty and variability to the extent it is possible. See the examples for more detailed explanations of each.

Because of the need for ranking, it is difficult to avoid some form of numerical scoring system. Diseases can be ranked purely based on the final qualitative assessment, but this does not allow for fine-grained discrimination between diseases. Instead, scoring can be done using a points-based system for different aspects of each disease, which then provides a basis for ranking and prioritising diseases, as shown in the first example where a semi-quantitative system is used to rank the diseases based on their scores. The main difference between these and traditionally semi-quantitative approaches is that they are single-dimensional. The scoring of the disease determines its rank, but the different disease-specific criteria are not themselves weighted. This means these analyses can be more focussed on a single risk question than traditional semi-quantitative approaches. Exploring semi-quantitative approaches as well will help you understand which is most suitable to you.

Semi-quantitative disease prioritisation is a well-established method, and there are several off-the-shelf tools available to do this. They generally have two dimensions; 1) Disease risks, which are parameterised across a range of criteria and 2) criteria weights, which determine the priority each criteria has in the ranking. For example, in the ECDC tool key criteria for measurements are established, such as risk of incursion, and  then assessed independently for each disease. Weights are attributed to these criteria, based on their relative importance to each other, e.g. if criteria A is deemed more important than criteria B then it will get a higher weight.  In a separate sheet a ranking of diseases will be produced based on these user inputs. The ANSES tool works in a similar way although it also provides a numeric risk estimate, and uncertainty estimate. Both tools rely on the user providing their own data for each disease, and efficacy of the output is largely reliant on the quality of these data. The SPARE tool listed below is pre-parameterised, and the user can only determine the weights attributed to each criterion. These tools perform basic prioritisation functions, but it is recommended that you do a qualitative risk assessment alongside them. Though the D2R2 tool isnâ€™t publicly available, a paper about it is listed to offer additional information. The final example, while not a prioritisation itself, highlights how different stakeholder opinions can affect the ranking of diseases. This is worth considering when parameter values rely heavily on expert opinion. MINTRISK is a different in that it can perform semi-quantitative risk assessment with or without prioritisation. As such it does not use 'weighted' criteria in the same way."

Much of the process is data acquisition across numerous potential threats and changes in their global prevalence in order to obtain a cross-section of all emerging threats, as in the fisheries example listed. It may also consider changes in global factors, such as habitat fragmentation, natural disasters or political turmoil: anything that may lead to significant disturbances in disease prevalence or transmission . To understand the risks these threats pose in more detail, frameworks such as the HAIRS framework are useful. It uses a qualitative algorithm to determine the risk level of an emerging threat between negligible and very high."
